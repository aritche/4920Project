1. Have npm installed
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

This should start up the development server on localhost:3000, which will auto reload on any changes to js files, so no need to rerun it!

File structure:
public - contains our index.html and global css and image files
src -
    index.js - shouldn't need to touch this file, it just tells React our App component is the main one
    App.js - the top level component
    Routes.js - where we set up what to display at which url
    navigation - all our navigation stuff
    pages - where we keep all our pages
    widgets - components that are reusable across the app
    constants.js - where we keep our constants so we don't have tons of strings lying around the app
    registerServiceWorker.js - file automatically generated by create-react-app, does some optimisations that we don't really need to care about
